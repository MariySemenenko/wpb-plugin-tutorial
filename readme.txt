A simple tutorial plugin that adds a "Follow Us" message at the end of every post.

== Description ==
This plugin adds a custom message at the end of each post, encouraging readers to follow your social profiles on Twitter and Facebook.

Great for beginners learning plugin development.

== Installation ==
1. Upload the plugin folder to the `/wp-content/plugins/` directory.
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress.
3. Visit any single post to see the "Follow Us" message.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==
= Can I change the message? =
In this basic version, you need to edit the plugin file directly. Future versions may include a settings page.

Yes, the message is hooked into `the_content`, so any theme that displays post content using `the_content()` will work fine.
